------------------------- Getting started -------------------------

To get started: Set up a directory to store playlists, you will need
to make sure that the playlists_path is pointing to this directory.

The playlists are all stored as tab-delimited text files, which can 
be generated from iTunes with:
   File > Library > Export Playlist...

Save your playlist like this into your playlist_path and you're 
ready to use the application.

Note: Once this is done correctly you may need to hit 'refresh'. 
You should see your playlists at the top.


---------------------- Using the application ----------------------

1. Select a playlist from the top and press the 'Add' button.

2. Repeat with a second playlist that you would like to compare to
the first. (If you want to remove one from consideration, 
highlight the playlist from the top and click 'Remove').

3. Choose how you would like to combine the playlists using the 
radio buttons at the bottom and click 'Compare'.

4. A window with the result will appear with the resulting merge, 
you can enter a name and click 'save' to save it as a new playlist.
The resulting text file will appear in the output directory.

5. To import to iTunes, select File > Library > Export Playlist... 
from iTunes, then navigate to the file in your output folder.
