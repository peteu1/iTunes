Goal: Make a stand-alone executable using Python that compares and creates new playlists using various joins of existing playlists.

The playlists are all stored as tab-delimited text files, which can be generated from iTunes with File > Library > Export Playlist...
Output playlists can be imported in the same manner with Import Playlist...
