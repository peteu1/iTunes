# iTunes

Project: An application that compares and combines iTunes playlists to create a more organized playlist collection.

Goals: 
- Learn to make a stand-alone executable application with Python/tkinter
- Build on GUI skills to help with automated reporting
- Implement and augment old code that compares and creates new playlists using various joins of existing playlists
- Organize and consolidate my plethora of dis-organized, over-lapping iTunes playlists


The playlists are all stored as tab-delimited text files, which can be generated from iTunes with File > Library > Export Playlist...

Output playlists can be imported in the same manner with Import Playlist...
